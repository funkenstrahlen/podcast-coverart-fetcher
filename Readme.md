# podcast-coverart-fetcher

Sometimes I need to get highres coverart images of podcasts. I created this script to easily fetch the coverart image of a podcast by simply providing the podcast rss feed.

## Requirements

Install these packages

```
pip install pyPodcastParser requests
```

## Usage

See help using `python podcast-coverart-fetcher.py -h`.
